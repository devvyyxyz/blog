Setting up permissions for your Discord server is one of the most important steps to keep your community secure, well-managed, and scalable.

In this guide, we break down a **tier-based role structure** that includes **every permission available on Discord as of 2025**, along with explanations of what each permission does. We also recommend powerful moderation tools like **YAGPDB** to automate and enhance your server's management.

## Why Role Permissions Matter

Discord permissions allow you to control what users can and can’t do. Without careful role setup:
- Staff may accidentally access sensitive settings  
- Users may exploit missing restrictions  
- Your server becomes harder to manage as it grows

A good role system empowers your staff while keeping your server safe and organized.

## Recommended Role Tiers

| Tier Name        | Description                            |
|------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Trial Moderator** | Entry-level helpers with basic moderation powers |
| **Moderator**       | Trusted moderators with full moderation powers |
| **Trial Admin**     | Senior mods with server config access |
| **Admin**           | Full server managers (excluding Administrator perm) |

Each role inherits permissions from the tier below it.

## The Danger of “Administrator”

While convenient, the `Administrator` permission gives:
- Total access to all server and channel permissions  
- The ability to override role-based restrictions  
- Complete control over the server, even if other permissions are missing

**Tip:** Create an "Owner" role with the Administrator permission, and assign it only to yourself or trusted bot devs.
