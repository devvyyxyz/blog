# Supercharge Your Discord Server: 5 Must-Have Features & Tools

Want to take your Discord server to the next level? Whether you're building a niche community or just want to keep your friends engaged, there are some powerful features you can add to make your server more fun, safer, and better organized.

Here are **5 essential upgrades** every server should consider, complete with **recommended bots, tools, and setup guides**.

---

## #1 – Automod with Regex Rules for Better Moderation

Discord's built-in **AutoMod** is a fantastic tool for keeping your server clean—but you can supercharge it by adding **custom regex filters**.

### Why Use Regex?
Regex lets you detect and block:
- Suspicious links (e.g. IP grabbers, scam domains)
- Fake Discord invites
- Spammy mentions or character abuse

### Useful Resource:
> **Regex Rules Collection:**  
> [https://devvyyxyz.github.io/discord-regex-rules](https://devvyyxyz.github.io/discord-regex-rules)

This site includes a curated set of common patterns to block harmful content automatically.

### How to Add Regex to AutoMod:
1. Go to **Server Settings > AutoMod**
2. Create a **Custom Rule**
3. Choose "Block message content"
4. Add regex patterns from the list above

### Guide:

## #2 – Add Fun Bots for Games and Economy

Engagement is key to keeping your community alive. Add some fun and lighthearted bots to your server—people love them.

### Recommended Bots:
- **Cat Bot** – Share and collect cats. Simple and cute.  
- **Dank Memer** – Memes, currency, robbery, and chaos.  
- **UnbelievaBoat** – Jobs, gambling, leaderboards.  
- **Pokétwo** – Catch and collect Pokémon that appear randomly in chat.

These bots give users things to do, compete over, and talk about—even when conversation is slow.

## #3 – Implement a Smarter Age Gate

If your server has **18+ channels or roles**, it's smart to **delay access** until new users have settled in.

Using **YAGPDB** or similar bots, you can:
- Set up a **role reaction menu**
- Delay access to certain roles for a period (e.g., 48 hours after joining)
- Optionally require manual mod approval for age-restricted roles

### Why This Matters:
Instant access to sensitive content can attract trolls or underage users. A delay helps ensure only legitimate users gain access.

## #4 – Use Forum Channels for Better Organization

Tired of fast-moving channels where posts get buried? Try converting certain channels into **forum-style discussion boards**.

### Ideal For:
- Help and support
- Media sharing (art, fits, setups)
- Q&A or idea feedback
- Topic-specific communities

### Benefits:
- Each topic/post becomes its own thread
- Replies stay grouped and easy to follow
- Prevents spammy walls of messages

### How to Set It Up:
1. Create a new **Forum Channel**
2. Set appropriate tags (e.g. “Tech Help”, “Outfit Post”, etc.)
3. Encourage users to start new threads instead of chatting in general

### Guide:

## #5 – Add a “Question of the Day/Week” Bot

Keep your community talking with a **Question of the Day (QOTD)** bot. It automatically posts questions on a schedule and pings users to join in.

### Recommended Bot:
- **Question of the Day Bot**
(Available on [top.gg](https://top.gg/bot/713586207119900693))

### Features:
- Schedule daily, weekly, or monthly questions
- Let users submit their own ideas
- Customize questions to match your server’s theme or vibe

### Pro Tip:
Use themed questions (e.g., horror, goth, retro, etc.) to match your server’s culture and aesthetic.

## Bonus Features to Consider

Here are a few **extra ideas** that go a long way:

### 1. **Onboarding Experience**
Use bots like **Carl-bot** or **ServerMate** to greet new users with:
- Rule popups
- Channel guides
- Role menus

### 2. **Event Scheduling**
Host game nights, movie nights, or Q&As using bots like:
- [**Sesh**](https://sesh.fyi)
- [**DisCal**](https://www.discalbot.com/)

### 3. **Interest Roles**
Let users pick roles based on:
- Pronouns
- Favorite games
- Aesthetic groups
- Notification preferences

This helps them connect with like-minded members and control pings.

## Final Thoughts

Whether you're running a 50-person friend group or a 5,000+ member community, these features make a real difference. From moderation and organization to engagement and vibe—investing in your server’s structure pays off in happier, more active members.

2. Invite 1–2 fun bots to liven up your community.  
3. Set up a delayed age-gate system with YAGPDB.
