## Introduction

Protecting your Instagram account is essential to maintaining your privacy and controlling who sees your content. In this guide, we’ll show you how to switch your account to private, enable key security features, and review your current follower list.

## Step 1: Switch to a Private Account

1. **Open Instagram** on your mobile device.
2. Tap your **profile picture** in the lower right corner to open your profile.
3. Tap the **three horizontal lines** (menu) in the top right, then select **Settings**.
4. Go to **Privacy** and toggle on **Private Account**.

This setting ensures that only approved followers can see your posts, stories, and profile information.

## Step 2: Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

1. In **Settings**, tap **Security**.
2. Select **Two-Factor Authentication** and then tap **Get Started**.
3. Choose your preferred method (text message or authentication app) and follow the prompts to complete setup.

With 2FA enabled, even if someone gets hold of your password, they’ll need a second form of verification to access your account.

## Step 3: Review Your Follower List

4. Visit your **Profile** and tap on **Followers**.
5. Identify any accounts you no longer wish to share your content with.
6. Tap the **three-dot icon** next to a follower’s name and select **Remove Follower**.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you’ll enhance the privacy and security of your Instagram account, ensuring that your personal content is visible only to those you trust. Stay proactive about your online security to enjoy a safer social media experience.
