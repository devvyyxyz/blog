## What Is Unreal Engine 5?

Unreal Engine 5 is developed by Epic Games and brings groundbreaking features like **Nanite** (a virtualized geometry system that allows for film-quality asset rendering without complex level-of-detail management) and **Lumen** (a dynamic global illumination system that reacts to scene changes in real time). These innovations enable creators to build immersive, expansive worlds with unprecedented visual fidelity.
