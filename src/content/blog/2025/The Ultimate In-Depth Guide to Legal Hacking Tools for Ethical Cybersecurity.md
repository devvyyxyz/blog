## Introduction

In today's digital landscape, cybersecurity is more critical than ever. Organizations and individuals alike need to defend against sophisticated attacks and vulnerabilities. This is where ethical hacking—or penetration testing—comes into play. By simulating real-world cyber attacks in a legal and controlled environment, ethical hackers can identify weaknesses before malicious actors do.

This in-depth guide will walk you through some of the best legal hacking tools available, how they work, and practical use cases for each. Whether you're a seasoned penetration tester or just starting your journey in cybersecurity, understanding these tools is key to building a robust defense strategy.

**Important:** Always ensure you have explicit, written permission before testing any system or network. The tools discussed in this article are intended for legal and ethical use only.

### Example Usage

To launch the Metasploit console:

===
msfconsole
===

Within the console, search for an exploit related to FTP:

===
search type:exploit name:ftp
===

This command searches for FTP-related exploits, which you can then configure and run.
