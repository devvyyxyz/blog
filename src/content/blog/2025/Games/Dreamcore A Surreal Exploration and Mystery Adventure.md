Dreamcore by Montraluz (published by Tlön industries) is an indie exploration game that blends nostalgia and mystery with a dreamlike aesthetic. The original poolrooms demo, released on August 23rd, 2024, garnered interest for its unique visual style, inspired by The Backrooms, Nostalgicore, and Matt studios artworks. It featured surreal environments, familiar settings, and psychological horror that transport players to liminal spaces brimming with eerie beauty bridging that gap most had yeearned for.  
  
Today (as of writting this review) me an early playtester for "Dreamcore: Eternal Suburbia" can now voice my thoughts.  
  
The gameplay revolves around navigating "non-linear" dream world, trying to find the exit to progress further in the game along w great visuals complemented by amazing sound design. This creation of a constant sense of suspense, complemented by nostalgic music and unsettling visuals brings players or user to still feel that sense of horror ever present in the first demo "Dreamcore: Dreampools".  
  
The previous demo has received praise for its immersive design, though the game is still collecting more user feedback for refinement. Dreamcore is recommended for fans of psychological exploration games and those intrigued by surrealist aesthetics or the ever growing popular Backroks Genre. I too stand by recommending it to those new to both genres and those already familiar.  
  
You can explore the demo and learn more about the game on its Steam page. (This is in case I post this review elsewhere)
